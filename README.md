# Number-of-days-of-the-year
A small program that will ask the user for a day, month and year and calculate how many days in that year have passed.
For example, if the user
enters 3rd February 2021 (3, 2, 2021), then that is the 34th day of the year.
(31 days in January, plus 3 in February).
Leap years are taken in consideration
Only valid dates â€“ for example 29 February 2021 is an invalid date
